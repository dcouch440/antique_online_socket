## `About`

This is a socket server for my social media application ( https://github.com/dcouch440/antique_social_media )

This socket handles Online status by using queries to toggle on and off online statuses based on weather a user has a connection or not to this server while viewing the website.
  
The user then queries the database from the app and gets a real representation of weather a user is online or not.
